The target audience for Increaser comprises knowledge workers who frequently use computers, such as programmers, designers, marketers, and engineers, as well as students. It is especially beneficial for remote workers, who often have greater control over their time and more flexibility to adopt practices that enhance productivity.

Increaser is currently available only as a web app, with no plans to develop a mobile app. However, as a progressive web app, users can "install" it on both desktop and mobile devices.

Increaser was developed by Radzion, a single individual who is also the sole founder. I have been working on Increaser for over five years. While I enjoy working on it, Increaser has not yet generated revenue, so I also work full-time as a software engineer.

Increaser offers a 14-day free trial, with a monthly subscription of $5.99 and an annual subscription for $47.88.

Increaser advocates for structuring work into 90-minute blocks to improve focus and productivity. Each block includes work sessions with breaks of no more than 15 minutes.

The "Home" page features a section for setting a break between work session ranging from 5 to 30 minutes, with an option to set an unlimited break. Break duration is automatically suggested based on the user's work session duration. The user can enable automatic blocks that will start after a work session if the current work block doesn't exceed 90 minutes.

Next, the "Home" page displays an interface for starting a work session. Project options are sorted based on user's weekly goals completion, prompting the user to work on projects that are behind schedule. Below the project selector, the user can see a an overview of how much they worked on a project this week, and if they have a goal, also a visual representation of how much they worked compared to their goal, and what is their progress relative to current week day.

On the side of "Home" and "Focus" pages there is a timeline featuring a icons with daily events such as time to start and end work, and first/last meals. The content of the timeline is user sessions colored to projects they belong to. Sessions are organized into blocks based on the breaks between them. At the top of the timeline users can navigate between the days of the current week.

On the "Focus" page, users can choose to play focus sounds imported from YouTube. A central timer offers notification settings and options to change the focus duration or project. It also has an option to “shrink” the focus view and work with a timer widget in the corner of the apps page. The focus page also displays the same timeline as the homepage.

The "Tasks" page has two sections: "To do" and "Done." In the "To Do" section user can add, edit and delete their tasks. Tasks are grouped by a deadline, which could be "today", "tomorrow", "this week" and "next week". Completed tasks will automatically move to the "done" section. Completed tasks are automatically deleted at the beginning of the next week.

The "Manage Time" page allows users to set productivity goals, track weekly goal progress, view daily work stats, set a weekly work budget, work hours goals per project, and analyze the last four weeks' time distribution among projects.

The "Habits" page has sections for "My Habits" and "Curated Habits." "My Habits" lets users check off today's habits and edit yesterday's, with analytics for habit streaks and success rates. "Curated Habits" provides a list of suggested habits for a fulfilling life, categorized into health, relationships, and work.

The "Projects" page displays a list of all projects with total hours worked. Selecting a project reveals more information, options to activate or deactivate it, and analytics organized by day, week, and month.

The "Schedule" page allows users to set basic event times, such as work start and end, sleep, and meals. Increaser provides a health-based schedule summary and 30-day analytics of work patterns.

Finally, the community page features a leaderboard of the most productive users over the past seven days, based on total daily work hours. Users are anonymous by default but can choose to display their name and country on the leaderboard.

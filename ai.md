The target audience for Increaser comprises knowledge workers who frequently use computers, such as programmers, designers, marketers, and engineers, as well as students. It is especially beneficial for remote workers, who often have greater control over their time and more flexibility to adopt practices that enhance productivity.

Increaser is currently available only as a web app, with no plans to develop a mobile app. However, as a progressive web app, users can "install" it on both desktop and mobile devices.

Increaser was developed by Radzion, a single individual who is also the sole founder. I have been working on Increaser for over five years. While I enjoy working on it, Increaser has not yet generated revenue, so I also work full-time as a software engineer.

Increaser offers a 14-day free trial, with a monthly subscription of $5.99 and an annual subscription for $47.88.

Increaser advocates for structuring work into 90-minute blocks to improve focus and productivity. Each block includes work sessions with breaks of no more than 15 minutes.

The homepage features a section to start a work session and highlights the user's progress compared to their goals. Users can choose any duration from 5 to 90 minutes, and the app automatically suggests durations and projects for optimal work blocks and minimal context switching. It also visualizes break duration and time elapsed since the last session. The app automatically starts a suggested break at the end of a session when appropriate, and users can adjust the duration. Additionally, there is a simple to-do list for the week's most important tasks and a list of today's habits. Users can manually add a focus session to the timeline, similar to the one on the focus page, and edit the duration or project of the last work session. Icons on the timeline indicate major daily events, such as the start and end of the workday, meals, etc. The timeline also includes the remaining time until the end of the workday, options to add a work session, remove the last session, or edit its project or duration.

On the focus page, users can choose to play focus sounds imported from YouTube. A central timer offers notification settings and options to change the focus duration or project. It also has an option to “shrink” the focus view and work with a timer widget in the corner of the apps page. The focus page also displays the same timeline as the homepage.

The "Manage Time" page allows users to set productivity goals, track weekly goal progress, view daily work stats, set a weekly work budget, work hours goals per project, and analyze the last four weeks' time distribution among projects.

The "Habits" page has sections for "My Habits" and "Curated Habits." "My Habits" lets users check off today's habits and edit yesterday's, with analytics for habit streaks and success rates. "Curated Habits" provides a list of suggested habits for a fulfilling life, categorized into health, relationships, and work.

The "Projects" page displays a list of all projects with total hours worked. Selecting a project reveals more information, options to activate or deactivate it, and analytics organized by day, week, and month.

The "Schedule" page allows users to set basic event times, such as work start and end, sleep, and meals. Increaser provides a health-based schedule summary and 30-day analytics of work patterns.

Finally, the community page features a leaderboard of the most productive users over the past seven days, based on total daily work hours. Users are anonymous by default but can choose to display their name and country on the leaderboard.

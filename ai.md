You will be helping me with tasks related to the Increaser product. Read more about Increaser below and reply "Yes" if you understand the product.

The target audience for Increaser comprises knowledge workers who frequently use computers, such as programmers, designers, marketers, and engineers, as well as students. It is especially beneficial for remote workers, who often have greater control over their time and more flexibility to adopt practices that enhance productivity and provide better work-life balance.

Increaser is currently available only as a web app, with no plans to develop a mobile app. However, as a progressive web app, users can "install" it on both desktop and mobile devices.

Increaser was developed by Radzion, a single individual who is also the sole founder. I have been working on Increaser for over five years. While I enjoy working on it, Increaser has not yet generated revenue, so I also work full-time as a software engineer.

Increaser offers a 14-day free trial, with a monthly subscription of $5.99 and an annual subscription for $47.88.

Increaser advocates structuring work into 90-minute blocks to improve focus and productivity. Each block includes work sessions with breaks of no more than 15 minutes.

The "Home" page features a section for setting a break between work sessions ranging from 5 to 30 minutes, with an option to set an unlimited break. Break duration is automatically suggested based on the user's work session duration. The user can enable automatic blocks that will start after a work session if the current work block does not exceed 90 minutes. When the user has worked for more than 90 minutes, it's time to take an "unlimited" break.

Next, the "Home" page displays an interface for starting a work session. Project options are sorted based on the user's weekly goal completion, prompting the user to work on projects that are behind schedule. Below the project selector, the user can see an overview of how much they have worked on a project this week, and if they have a goal, also a visual representation of how much they have worked compared to their goal, and what their progress is relative to the current weekday. The user can change or set those goals on the "Projects Budget" page.

On the side of the "Home" and "Focus" pages, there is a timeline featuring icons with daily events such as the times to start and end work, and first/last meals. The times of these events can be changed on the "Schedule" page. The content of the timeline is user sessions colored according to the projects they belong to. Sessions are organized into blocks based on the breaks between them. At the top of the timeline, users can navigate between the days of the current week. If they forgot to start a focus session, they can add it manually by clicking on the "Add Session" button at the bottom of the timeline. Also, the user can edit or delete the last session from the timeline.

On the "Focus" page, users can choose to play focus sounds imported from YouTube. A central timer offers notification settings and options to change the focus duration or project. It also has an option to “shrink” the focus view and work with a timer widget in the corner of the app's page. The focus page also displays the same timeline as the homepage.

On the "Projects" page, users can see all their projects and edit and delete them. Each project has a name, emoji, color, and a status which can be "active," "inactive," or "archived."

On the "Track Time" page, the user can see an overview of how much time they have spent on each project. They can organize data in the report by days, weeks, or months, crop the data, e.g., show only the last 7 days, and they can toggle if they want to see the current period in the report, e.g., the current week. The user can highlight a specific project and also see the total time spent on all projects.

On the "Work Budget" page, the user can set a preferred time they want to work on a workday and on a weekend. Next to it, they can see analytics with their average workday and weekend over the last 30 days, and totals of the last 4 weeks.

On the "Projects Budget" page, users can budget project time for a week, where the total budgeted time should not exceed the work budget defined on the "Work Budget" page. The user can see the progress of the project budget and the total time spent on the project this week. The user can see the allocation of time, add new budgets, and edit/delete existing project budgets. On top of that, they can set a goal to work "at least X hours" or "no more than X hours" on a project. For example, users may want to work less on some projects, for example, their remote job, and more on their business project. Also, they can select if they work on the project "Monday to Friday" or "Everyday." On the side of the page, they can see their progress on the weekly goals in the current week.

The "Habits" page has sections for "My Habits" and "Curated Habits." "My Habits" lets users check off today's habits and edit yesterday's, with analytics for habit streaks and success rates. "Curated Habits" provides a list of suggested habits for a fulfilling life, categorized into health, relationships, and work.

The "Tasks" page has two sections: "To Do" and "Done." In the "To Do" section, users can add, edit, and delete their tasks. Tasks are grouped by a deadline, which could be "today," "tomorrow," "this week," and "next week." Completed tasks will automatically move to the "done" section. Completed tasks are automatically deleted at the beginning of the next week.

Finally, the "Community" page features a leaderboard of the most productive users over the past seven days, based on total daily work hours. Users are anonymous by default but can choose to display their name and country on the leaderboard. It also includes the founder's contacts and a board where the user can suggest new features and vote for existing ones.

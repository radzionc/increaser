Hey! Radzion here. Today, let's explore how Increaser's Task Management tool helps you stay organized, productive, and in control of your work. It's more than just a task list—it's a system that works seamlessly with your goals, projects, and focus sessions.

With Increaser, managing tasks is super easy. On the "Tasks" page, you'll find a kanban board that keeps everything clear and structured. Tasks move between four columns: backlog, to-do, in-progress, and done. You can drag and drop tasks as you work through them, always knowing what comes next.

If you're someone who likes planning ahead, the "Upcoming" subpage is your go-to. Here, you can see your tasks grouped by day or week, and plan out your work in advance. Have recurring tasks? No problem. You'll see forecasted tasks for the future, and you can even create them early if you want to get a head start.

Our automation subpage allows you to set up recurring tasks with ease—perfect for those repeating things you do every week or month. Set up a rule once, and let Increaser handle the rest.

To make things even better, the task templates feature saves you time. If there are tasks you do repeatedly, create a template—then, next time, you can create a new task in just a couple of clicks.

You can link tasks directly to your projects, which makes everything more efficient. During focus sessions, you'll have all your task details, links, and checklists right there—no need to switch back and forth.

Speaking of focus sessions, the Task Management tool is closely tied with Focus. Whenever you start a session, you can easily pick the task you're working on, update it, or add a checklist—keeping everything on track. This is where the real power of Increaser shows: no more juggling between different tools. Everything you need is in one place.

Finally, completed tasks are automatically cleared at the end of the week, which keeps your workspace organized and clutter-free.

With Increaser's Task Management, you'll find that your work is not only better planned but also less stressful. Stay focused, keep your priorities clear, and get more done—effortlessly.

Thanks for watching! If you haven't tried managing your tasks with Increaser yet, go ahead and give it a shot. You'll love the difference it makes.

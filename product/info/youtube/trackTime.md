Hey! Radzion here. Today, I want to talk about one of the core tools in Increaser—Time Tracking. If you've ever wondered where all your time goes or how to make the most of it, this is the tool that can help you take back control of your day.

With Time Tracking, you can easily log the hours you spend on different projects and tasks. It all starts with focus sessions—structured blocks of uninterrupted work. During a focus session, Increaser helps you stay on track and makes sure your time is spent efficiently. Just select a project, maybe even a task, hit start, and you're in the zone.

Increaser's Time Tracking works hand in hand with other tools. For example, on the "Projects" page, you can budget how much time you'd like to spend on each project during the week. Time Tracking keeps you updated on your progress, showing you how close you are to reaching your goals. This means you get to see how you’re distributing your time and adjust if needed.

And then there’s the "Goals" page—time tracking isn’t just about hours worked, it’s about moving towards your vision. By setting up goals and linking tasks to those goals, every minute tracked gets you closer to what matters most.

Plus, Increaser lets you easily edit or adjust your tracked time. Forgot to start the timer? No problem—you can adjust the session start time. And if you were working more than expected, you can always extend the end time. You get the flexibility to make sure your records match reality, without any hassle.

Tracking your time consistently helps you uncover your work habits and become more aware of where your energy goes. Over time, you'll start to see patterns in the "Report" page—how much time you've put into each project, week by week, month by month. This gives you valuable insights and lets you make informed decisions about your productivity.

So, if you're ready to gain real control over your schedule and get meaningful work done—start tracking your time with Increaser today. It's simple, it's effective, and it might just change the way you work.

Thanks for watching, and as always, keep increasing your productivity. See you next time!

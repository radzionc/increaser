Hey! Radzion here.

Are you ready to turn your vision of a perfect life into reality? Today, I'm excited to introduce you to the "Goals" tool in Increaser—the bridge between your dreams and your daily actions.

With the "Goals" tool, you can set, track, and achieve your personal and professional objectives in a structured and meaningful way. Here's how it works:

First, you can create goals and categorize them as active, done, or ideas for future consideration. Each goal is customizable—you can add a name, choose an inspiring emoji, and set a deadline that's either a specific date or tied to your age. This personal touch makes your goals more relatable and motivating.

For measurable goals, like increasing your net worth or running a certain distance, you can input your current progress directly into the app. This real-time tracking helps you stay on top of your objectives and see how far you've come.

One of the powerful features of the "Goals" tool is its seamless integration with other tools in Increaser. You can link your goals to recurring tasks or daily habits, ensuring that every day you're taking steps toward your aspirations. For example, if your goal is to write a book, you can set up a daily habit to write for 30 minutes and connect it directly to your goal.

At the top of the "Goals" page, you'll find a dynamic timeline that visually maps out your goals according to their deadlines. You can switch between two views: age-based and date-based. In the age-based view, you see your age progressing with day-level precision, offering a personal perspective on your timeline. In the date-based view, you can focus on specific calendar years and plan accordingly.

By aligning your goals with your daily habits and tasks, the "Goals" tool transforms your vision into actionable steps. It's not just about setting targets; it's about creating a roadmap that keeps you motivated and accountable.

So why wait? Dive into the "Goals" tool today and start making tangible progress toward the life you've envisioned.

Thanks for watching!

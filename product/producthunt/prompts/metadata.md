You will help me make a launch of Increaser on Product Hunt. We will be posting it at the end of Novemer/start of December with a theme of achieving New Year's goals.

1. Give 10 options for a "Name of the product" Product Hunt launch title (40 characters max)
2. Give 10 options for a tagline for the Product Hunt launch (60 characters max)
3. Write a Product Hunt description for the launch (260 characters max)
4. Write the first comment (This comment will be posted when your product launches. Adding a first comment is essential to get the discussion started.)

For more context, this is a script for a YouTube video we'll be including in this Product Hunt launch:

Write a script for a YouTube video about achieving their New Year's goals with Increaser. It should leave the user motivated and eager to try the product. It should be no longer than 5 minutes, and it should connect all the primary features of the app in a purposeful way around achieving goals. It will be posted in December, so it should be focused on the upcoming year.

We should talk about vision before going into goal-setting. it's important to understand what viewer really wants in life. That's where vision board comes in, helping them to inspire and motivate themself. With a clear vision they can see what they want and don't want in their life, and come up with specific goals that will bring them closer to their vision.

They can come up with a ideas for their goals, and then pick the most meaningful ones to focus on. The can split their big goal for the year into smaller goals with quarterly milestones. They can make a high level plan for their goals, connect them with their vision, set guiding principles, and then connect with a practical part of daily habits and recurring tasks that will help them to achieve their goals.

Besides vision and goals, we should also explain which role other Increaser tools play in achieving those goals:

- Habits
- Tasks
- Focus
- Time tracking
- Work preferences
- Principles

Return it as a plain text ready to be put in teleprompter without any styling or comments, only exactly what I will say in the video, no bullet points, no markdown. Start the video with a short greeting, e.g. "Hey! Radzion here". Pages navigation might change, so let's not mention pages/subpages. Do not mention the exact year so the video can work for consecutive years. The video will be mostly watched by people who are not aware of the app, so make sure to explain everything clearly and have a smooth transition in the introduction from the topic of setting goals to the app.

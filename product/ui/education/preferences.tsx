      <h2>Setting Your Preferred Workday End Time</h2>
      <p>
        On the <strong>Preferences</strong> page, you can specify the time you
        aim to finish work each day. This setting influences several aspects of
        the app:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Focus Page:</strong> A countdown at the bottom of the timeline
          shows how much time is left until your workday ends, helping you stay
          on schedule.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Notifications:</strong> Five minutes before your workday ends,
          you'll receive a notification to wrap up your tasks.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Focus Launcher:</strong> After your set end time, the Focus
          launcher is disabled by default to encourage rest, but you can unlock
          it if you need to continue working.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Timesheet Page:</strong> When viewing your work grouped by
          days, a line represents your preferred end of work time, allowing you
          to see if you're consistently working past your intended hours.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Selecting Your Weekend Days</h2>
      <p>
        You can choose which days are considered weekends in your schedule. If
        you don't follow a traditional workweek, you can adjust or remove
        weekend days entirely. This setting affects:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Work Budget:</strong> It impacts your total work budget by
          allowing you to specify different work hours for workdays and
          weekends.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Projects:</strong> Projects marked as "workday only" will
          consider your weekend settings to accurately display progress on the
          Focus page and Focus launcher.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Recurring Tasks:</strong> Recurring tasks set to occur on
          workdays will respect your designated weekend days, ensuring tasks
          don't appear when you're off.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Timesheet Page:</strong> When viewing work grouped by days,
          the app displays average work hours for both workdays and weekends,
          giving you insights into your productivity patterns.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Creating Your Personal Work Budget</h2>
      <p>
        You can specify how many hours you plan to work on workdays and
        weekends. This personal work budget influences:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Project Budgets and Goals:</strong> When setting up projects
          on the <strong>Projects</strong> page, the total budgeted time is
          capped by your overall work budget, helping you allocate time wisely.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cumulative Chart:</strong> On the Projects page, a cumulative
          chart displays two lines—your "expected work time" based on your work
          budget and your actual "total time worked"—allowing you to see if
          you're on track.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Timesheet Page:</strong> When viewing work grouped by weeks,
          you'll see a line representing the budgeted time for projects, helping
          you monitor progress and adjust efforts to meet your goals.
        </li>
      </ul>

Hey everyone, Radzion here.

I've got some exciting updates to share with you about Increaser.

First up, we've added a new option to switch the Goals timeline view between age-based and date-based formats. This means you can now choose how you want to visualize your goals—whether by your age milestones or specific dates—making it easier to plan ahead.

We've also made the form for creating and editing goals more comfortable and compact. It's now quicker to set up your goals without unnecessary hassle.

On the "Tasks" page, you'll notice a new "Start" button next to each task. This lets you launch a focus session for a selected task instantly, streamlining your workflow.

Additionally, Increaser now auto-selects the last task you worked on for a project whenever you switch to that project. This small tweak saves you time and keeps you on track with your work.

Finally, we've added a new "Achieve goals" article to the "Info" page. It's packed with tips and insights to help you make the most out of Increaser.

That's all for now. I'd love for you to try out these new features and let me know what you think. Your feedback is always appreciated.

Thanks for watching, and see you next time.

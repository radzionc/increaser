Hey everyone, Radzion here. Let's jump right into what's new in Increaser.

First up, we've made habits more flexible. You can now edit and reorder your habits directly from both the "Track" and "Stats" views on the "Habits" page. This makes it easier to adjust things as your routines evolve. And if there's a habit you want to start fresh, you can now reset it from the edit view.

Next, all "Tasks" sub-pages now have an "Add" button, so you can quickly create tasks wherever you are. We've also added the ability to turn an existing task into a template, and those templates will now always be available when you're creating or editing tasks.

We've made it easier to set a weekly goal for a project tooâ€”just a small quality-of-life improvement that should save you some time.

Lastly, we've added new articles about "Time tracking" and "Task Management" to the "Info" page. If you're curious about making the most of those tools, these articles should help.

That's it for the updates! If any of these changes resonate with you, go ahead and give them a try, and let us know what you think. Your feedback is always valuable. Thanks for watching!

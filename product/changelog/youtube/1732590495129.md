Hey everyone, Radzion here.

Weâ€™ve got some exciting updates to share with you today. Letâ€™s dive right in.

First, when creating a new principle, you can now add a new category directly within the process. No need to jump between pagesâ€”everything happens seamlessly.

Next, you can now add or link your existing principles to your goals. This makes it easier to align your goals with the lessons and values that matter most to you. Similarly, you can also add or link your vision to your goals, ensuring your aspirations are directly connected to what you're working toward.

Weâ€™ve also improved the principles section by letting you filter principle ideas by category, making it simpler to find the ones that resonate with you.

Lastly, weâ€™ve added new "Principles" and "Vision" articles to the Info page. These are designed to help you understand how to use these tools effectively and why theyâ€™re valuable.

Thatâ€™s all for now. Try out the updates and let me know what you thinkâ€”Iâ€™d love to hear your feedback!

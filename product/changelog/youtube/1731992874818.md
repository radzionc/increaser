Hey everyone, Radzion here. I'm excited to share some new updates to Increaser that I think you'll find really useful.

First off, you can now customize your weekend days or remove them entirely if you work the same amount every day. This flexibility lets you tailor Increaser to fit your unique schedule.

We've updated the project budget widget on the focus launcher and added it to the focus session page. It's now more compact, displays today's expected work time, and provides real-time progress tracking during your work sessions. This gives you a clearer picture of what you need to accomplish each day without having to switch pages.

The weekly comparison chart for work budget versus actual work has been reorganized. It now clearly shows the difference between your expected and completed hours, making it easier to track your weekly progress.

We've added a "Preferences" article to the "Info" page to help you make the most of these new customization options.

In the Tasks section, we've moved "Ideas" to their own tab on the "Tasks" page. You can now add links and checklists to your ideas, just like you can with tasks. Plus, you can reorder your ideas by dragging them around, making it easier to organize your thoughts.

That's it for now. I'd love for you to try out these new features and let me know what you think. Your feedback is really important to me. Thanks for watching!

Hey everyone, Radzion here. Let's jump right into the latest updates for Increaser.

First, you can now connect your goals to your habits. This means you can add new habits right from the goal view or link an existing habit to a goal. It's all about making it easier to track progress toward what really matters.

Next, to help you remember to track your habits, we've added a gentle nudge in the sidebar. If you haven't visited the "Habits" page today, you'll see a prompt next to it in the navigation. Just a quick reminder to keep those habits going.

We've also updated the weekly project report chart. Now, you can see a line showing the budgeted time for your selected projects, or the total budgeted time for all projects if you want the bigger picture. It's a small addition that should give you better insights into how you're pacing yourself.

The projects page also got a refresh. Now, each project displays not only its emoji and name but also its budget, goal, and a "Mon-Fri" label for workday-only projects. Plus, when creating or editing a project, you can set a weekly budget and goal right then and there. It's all about giving you more clarity and control over your work.

Finally, we moved the "Report" subpage from the "Projects" page to its own dedicated "Timesheet" page. This should make it easier to access and understand your overall work time.

That's it for now. I hope these updates make your experience with Increaser even better. Try them out and let me know what you think. Your feedback is always welcome.

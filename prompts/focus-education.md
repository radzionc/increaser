After the user signed up in the app they will appear on the focus page. At this point they are most likely don't know anything about the app and how it works. We should prompt them to learn more about the "Focus" feature and how it can help them to improve their productivity. You should write a comprehensive guide, while keeping it short as we don't want to overwhelm the user with too much information, yet it should cover all the important aspects of focus at Increaser, and should be interesting enough to keep the user engaged.

**Welcome to Focus with Increaser**

Ready to take control of your productivity? Let us guide you through how the Focus feature in Increaser can help you improve your concentration and get more done.

### What is Focus?

The Focus feature is designed to help you work deeply on your most important tasks without interruptions. By structuring your work sessions into focused blocks, you can build productive habits and make the most of your time. Here, you'll choose a task or project, set your focus duration, and get started!

### How It Works

1. **Choose a Project or Task**: Select a project and a specific task you want to work on. If you don't have a project or task yet, you can easily create one.
2. **Set Focus Duration**: Each focus session can be customized to suit your needs. We recommend 90-minute work blocks, which align with our philosophy of maximizing focus without burnout. You can also adjust the start time if you've already begun working.
3. **Start Working**: Hit "Start," and the timer begins. Stay focused on your taskâ€”Increaser will help you keep track of the time.
4. **Take Breaks**: After your session, it's time to take a well-deserved break. Increaser suggests the right break times based on your work session to keep you fresh and avoid fatigue.

### Why Use Focus?

- **Stay on Track**: The Focus feature helps you prioritize your work, providing an easy way to manage tasks without getting overwhelmed.
- **Set Clear Goals**: Visualize your progress with goals and see how much you've worked on each project this week.
- **Minimize Distractions**: Use focus music or ambient sounds to maintain an optimal working environment while avoiding external distractions.

### Tips to Get the Most Out of Focus

- **Use Breaks Wisely**: After each focus session, make sure to take a 5-15 minute break to recharge.
- **Track Your Progress**: You can monitor your daily and weekly achievements, allowing you to celebrate progress and make adjustments when needed.
- **Customize Your Sessions**: Whether it's changing the duration or the task, tailor each session to what works best for you.

You will be helping me with tasks related to the Increaser product. Read more about Increaser below and reply "Yes" if you understand the product.

# Target customer

The target audience for Increaser comprises knowledge workers who frequently use computers, such as programmers, designers, marketers, and engineers, as well as students. It is especially beneficial for remote workers, who often have greater control over their time and more flexibility to adopt practices that enhance productivity and provide better work-life balance.

# Platform

Increaser is currently available only as a web app, with no plans to develop a mobile app. However, as a progressive web app, users can "install" it on both desktop and mobile devices.

# Founder

Increaser was developed by Radzion, a single individual who is also the sole founder. I have been working on Increaser for over five years. While I enjoy working on it, Increaser has not yet generated revenue, so I also work full-time as a software engineer.

# Monetization

Increaser offers a 14-day free trial, with a monthly subscription of $5.99 and an annual subscription for $47.88.

# Increaser Tools

Increaser consists of the following primary tools:

- Vision
- Goals
- Time tracking
- Task management
- Work budgeting
- Time planning
- Deep work timer
- Habit tracking
- Scheduling

Each tool has a dedicated page within the app and a corresponding section on the website.

## Vision

The Vision Board allows users to define what their perfect life looks like. It consists of a list of "vision attributes," each serving as a description of a perfect life.

A vision attribute has:

- A name: e.g., "Happy marriage"
- An image: uploaded by the user
- An emoji: to represent the attribute

The vision page in the app has two subpages: "My vision" and "Vision ideas."

The "My vision" page consists of two tabs: "Board" and "Manage." The "Board" tab displays all vision attributes organized in a grid, while the "Manage" tab allows users to create, update, and delete vision attributes.

The "Vision ideas" page contains a list of suggested vision attributes to give users ideas for their vision board and help them define their perfect life.

## Deep work timer

The "Home" page features a section for setting a break between work sessions ranging from 5 to 30 minutes, with an option to set an unlimited break. Break duration is automatically suggested based on the user's work session duration. The user can enable automatic blocks that will start after a work session if the current work block does not exceed 90 minutes. When the user has worked for more than 90 minutes, it's time to take an "unlimited" break.

Increaser advocates structuring work into 90-minute blocks to improve focus and productivity. Each block includes work sessions with breaks of no more than 15 minutes.

Next, the "Home" page displays an interface for starting a work session—a focus launcher. Here, the user can select either a "projects" or "tasks" view. User can also create a project or a task right from the focus launcher. Project options are sorted based on the user's weekly goal completion, prompting the user to work on projects that are behind schedule. Below the project selector, the user can see an overview of how much they have worked on a project this week. If they have a goal, they will also see a visual representation of how much they have worked compared to their goal and what their progress is relative to the current weekday. The user can change or set those goals on the "Time planning" page. In the "tasks" view, the user will see a list of today's tasks with a project assigned to each. They can select a task, and the project for tracking will be derived from the project associated with the task. If they forgot to start a focus session and have already been working for some time, they can change the session start time on the focus launcher so that Increaser will track the time they worked before launching a session. During a focus session, the user can create, update, or delete tasks for the current focus project right from the focus session interface.

On the side of the "Home" page, there is a timeline featuring icons with daily events such as the times to start and end work, and first/last meals. The times of these events can be changed on the "Schedule" page. The content of the timeline is user sessions colored according to the projects they belong to. Sessions are organized into blocks based on the breaks between them. At the top of the timeline, users can navigate between the days of the current week.

The user can pause a session. If the session has been paused, after the user has finished the session, it will be split into multiple sessions to avoid tracking the periods when the user was not working.

If the user gets distracted and wants to account for that time, they can deduct the time from the session. It would act the same way as if the user paused the session for a specific period and then resumed it.

When the user starts a focus session, the content of the "Home" page changes. Instead of the focus launcher, an interface for managing the current active session appears. The user can change the start time of the session, desired duration, project, and task. If the user forgets to stop the session, it will be stopped automatically, and the user will be prompted to edit that session.

Also, while in the focus session, users can choose to play focus sounds imported from YouTube or arrange their own ambient noise by mixing different individual sounds like rain, a coffee shop, or birds singing, and adjusting their volume. The YouTube player will be positioned in the corner of the screen, and the user can change the corner, turn off the music, or pause it from that widget.

## Goals

On the "Goals" page, users can set specific goals that will bring them closer to their perfect vision. Goals have three potential statuses: done, in progress, and to-do. Users should set a deadline for a goal, which could be either a specific date or their age. Users can set an emoji for a goal. Users can write a plan of how they are going to achieve the goal in plain text. Users can track numeric goals; for example, if the goal is to have 1m USD net worth, they can enter their current net worth to see their progress. Since to achieve most goals, users have to do some recurring actions, there is a way to add recurring tasks or connect existing recurring tasks to the current goal. At the top of the Goals page is a timeline with age labels under the line and goals above the line. Users' current age with month and day precision is also displayed on the timeline.

On the side of the goals page, there is an educational section that summarizes wisdom on how to set and achieve goals. The user can collapse this section if they don't want to see it.

## Projects

On the "Projects" page, users can see all their projects and change their status, edit, or delete them. Each project has a name, emoji, color, and a status, which can be "active," "inactive," or "archived." There is one project which can’t be deleted—“Other.” When the user deletes a project, all the data associated with the deleted project will be reassigned to the “Other” project. User can reorder projects by dragging them.

## Time tracking

On the "Time Tracking" page, the user can see an overview of how much time they have spent on each project. They can organize data in the report by days, weeks, months, or years, crop the data, e.g., show only the last 7 days, and they can toggle if they want to see the current period in the report, e.g., the current week. The user can highlight a specific project and also see the total time spent on all projects.

While the user will primarily track their work through focus sessions, they can also track time by manually adding a focus session from the side timeline on the focus page. There, they can also edit and delete existing sessions.

## Work budget

On the "Work Budget" page, the user can set a preferred time they want to work on a workday and on a weekend. Next to it, they can see analytics with their average workday and weekend over the last 30 days, and totals of the last 4 weeks.

## Time planning

On the "Time planning" page, users can budget project time for a week, where the total budgeted time should not exceed the work budget defined on the "Work Budget" page. The user can see the progress of the project budget and the total time spent on the project this week. The user can see the allocation of time, add new budgets, and edit/delete existing project budgets. On top of that, they can set a goal to work "at least X hours" or "no more than X hours" on a project. For example, users may want to work less on some projects, such as their remote job, and more on their business project. Also, they can select if they work on the project "Monday to Friday" or "Everyday." On the side of the page, they can see their progress on the weekly goals for the current week.

## Habits

The "Habits" page has two top-level sections: "My habits" and "Habit ideas." "My Habits" consists of three sections. The "manage" section, where the user can reorder, edit, delete, and add new habits. The "track" section, which displays a table with the habits and checkboxes for the last 30 days, where the user can check off the habits they have done. They can also "reset" habits to have a fresh start by clicking on the "Reset habit(s)" button, which opens a modal where the user can select either all habits or specific habits to be reset. This will make them start from today and will remove all the tracked data. The "report" section contains a table of habits with a streak, success rate, and when the habit has been started. The "Habit ideas" section consists of a list of suggested habits for a fulfilling life, categorized into health, relationships, and work that the user can add to their habits.

## Tasks

The "Tasks" page has four subpages: "Tasks", "Upcoming", "Automation", and "Templates".

The "Tasks" subpage is a kanban board with four columns: backlog, todo, inProgress, and done. Users can filter tasks by project.

In the "Upcoming" subpage, tasks are grouped by day, and the user can drag and drop a task between days.

Completed tasks are automatically deleted at the beginning of the next week. A user can assign a task to a project. A user can add links to the task to easily access all the necessary external resources during a focus session. A user can add a checklist/subtasks to a task and then complete those sub-items during a focus session on that task. A user can write a description for a task. In the "Automation" subpage, users can set up rules for the automatic creation of recurring tasks. The cadence could be daily, every workday, every week, or every month. For weekly and monthly tasks, the user can select a "deadline index," which for a week would be a weekday and for the month the day of the month. For example, if the "deadline index" for a weekly task is 4, the task will be created every Friday. When the user adds a rule in that section, a new entity called "TaskFactory" is created. Editing or deleting a task created by a TaskFactory won't affect the TaskFactory. In the "Templates" subpage, users can create, edit, and delete task templates. A task template contains the same fields as a task, so when the user creates a task or a TaskFactory, if there are templates for a selected project, they will see an option to use a template, and if they select a template, the task form will be pre-filled with the template data. Tasks are created at the start of the period, but to make it clear for the user, we show "forecasted" recurring tasks on the "Upcoming" subpage. Those tasks are not created yet, and the user can only see them without the ability to edit or delete them.

## Start the day with Increaser

The goal of the “Start the day” page is to help the user start the day well. It consists of four steps. In the first step, they can see their vision defined on the "Vision" page through vision attributes. Then they can review their goals to remember what they are working towards. In the third step, the user has to submit their yesterday's habits completion by checking the checkboxes. In the fourth step, the user has to clear the "overdue" tasks and add tasks for today. After completing the last step, the user will be redirected to the home page.

## Schedule

On the "Schedule" page, the user can set the time when they want to start and finish work; wake up and go to bed; have their first and last meals. The app prompts the user to set the time so that they have 16 hours of intermittent fasting, no food 60 minutes after waking up, no food 3 hours before sleep, 2 hours of relaxation before bed, and an optimal 8 hours of sleep. Since Increaser can only know when the user started and finished work based on user time tracking, we show a report for the last 30 days showing the user's start and end work time, average time when they start work, average time when they finish work, and the number of times they worked late, e.g., after the user's set work end time.

## Ideas

On the "Ideas" page, the user can note down ideas for their projects to avoid forgetting them. An idea has a name, description, and project field. The user can turn an idea into a task by clicking on the "Turn into a task" button. The user can filter ideas by project.

## Principles

The "Principles" page consists of two sub-pages: "My principles" and "Principle ideas." The "My principles" page has two tabs: "Principles" and "Categories." On the principles page, the user can add, edit, and delete principles, which consist of a name, description, and category. On the categories page, the user can add, edit, and delete categories. A category consists of a name and an emoji. The "Principle ideas" page consists of a list of suggested principles for a fulfilling life, categorized into health, marriage, work, mindset, and finances that the user can add to their principles.

## What's New

When there is a new feature or a set of features, there is an announcement on the "What's new" page, which consists of a short clip without audio, a title, a description, and a list of items if it's more than a single update. You can get to the "What's new" page by clicking a bell icon in the top right corner of the sidebar. The bell icon will have a dot with the number of new announcements. When the user clicks on the bell icon, the dot will disappear.

## Request Features

On the "Request features" page, there is a list of features proposed by users that consist of a title, description, and an upvote button together with the number of total upvotes. The user can switch between the "ideas" and "done" tabs. To propose a feature, there is a small form on the side of the page so that the user can quickly submit a feature request. The new feature requests will be reviewed by the founder; before that, the feature won't be visible to other users.

## Community

Finally, the "Community" page features a leaderboard of the most productive users over the past seven days, based on total daily work hours. Users are anonymous by default.

## Public Profile

On the "Profile" page the user can enable "public profile" and then their name and country will be shown when they request features or when they are on the leaderboard. Only paid users can enable the public profile.

# Website

Increaser app is under the [app.increaser.org](http://app.increaser.org/) domain, while the Increaser website is under the [increaser.org](http://increaser.org/) domain. On the website, we are trying to persuade the user to try the app. The “Start now” button on the website leads to [app.increaser.org/sign-up](http://app.increaser.org/sign-up). The website positions Increaser as a productivity toolkit comprised of 9 tools: vision, goals, deep work timer, time tracking, task management, work budgeting, time planning, habit tracking, scheduling.

# Tech Stack

Increase code is within a TypeScript monorepo. The code is being deployed on AWS. To manage AWS infrastructure, I use Terraform. Both the app and the website are static NextJS apps. The API and other microservices are hosted as AWS Lambdas.

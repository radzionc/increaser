# App

## Vision

The Vision tool allows users to define what their perfect life looks like. It consists of a list of "vision attributes," each serving as a description of a perfect life.

The vision page in the app has two Subpages: "Board", and "Explore".

On the "Board" subpage, users can see all vision attributes displayed as a gallery of images. By hovering over an image, users can see the attribute's name and emoji. Users can click on an image to view the full description of the vision attribute, edit it, or delete it.

A vision attribute has:

- A name: e.g., "Happy marriage"
- An image: uploaded by the user
- An emoji: to represent the attribute
- A description: e.g., "I have a loving partner who supports me in everything I do."

The "Explore" subpage contains a list of suggested vision attributes to give users ideas for their vision board and help them define their perfect life. The user can add a suggested vision attribute to their vision board.

## Focus

Users can set breaks between work sessions ranging from 5 to 30 minutes, or choose an unlimited break. Break durations are suggested automatically based on the length of the previous work session. Users can enable automatic work blocks that start after a break if the total work time does not exceed 90 minutes. After working for more than 90 minutes, it's recommended to take an 'unlimited' break.

Increaser advocates structuring work into 90-minute blocks to improve focus and productivity. Each block includes work sessions with breaks of no more than 15 minutes.

Next, the "Focus" page displays an interface for starting a work session—a focus launcher. First, the user can select a project (required). Then, they can select a task (optional). If a project is selected, tasks will be filtered based on the assigned project. If no project is selected, all tasks will be displayed. To start a session, the user has to select either a task or a project. The user can also create a project or a task directly from the focus launcher. Project options are sorted based on the user's weekly goal completion, prompting the user to work on projects that are behind schedule.

For project with a budgeted time the user will see a widget on the focus launcher with a visual representation of how much they have worked compared to their budget and their progress relative to the current weekday. Increaser will calculate the expected work time the user should have completed by the current day of the week and show the user how much they are behind or ahead of schedule, with a colored highlight for projects with a goal to work at least or no more than a certain amount of time. This widget will also be visible during a focus session on the focus page and will be updated in real-time.

If they forget to start a focus session and have already been working for some time, they can change the session start time on the focus launcher so that Increaser will track the time they worked before launching a session. During a focus session, the user can create, update, or delete tasks for the current focus project directly from the focus session interface.

On the side of the "Focus" page there is a timeline with the user sessions colored according to the projects they belong to. Sessions are organized into blocks based on the breaks between them. At the top of the timeline, users can navigate between the days of the current week. At the bottom of the timeline displayed the duration left until the end of the workday.

The user can pause a session. If the session has been paused, after the user has finished the session, it will be split into multiple sessions to avoid tracking the periods when the user was not working. The focus music will be paused when the session is paused.

If the user gets distracted and wants to account for that time, they can deduct the time from the session. It would act the same way as if the user paused the session for a specific period and then resumed it.

When the user starts a focus session, the content of the "Focus" page changes. Instead of the focus launcher, an interface for managing the current active session appears. The user can change the start time of the session, desired duration, project, and task.

If the user forgets to stop the session and it goes for more than 3 hours, Increaser will stop it automatically, and the user will see a modal with the option to adjust the end time.

Also, while in the focus session, users can choose to play focus sounds imported from YouTube or arrange their own ambient noise by mixing different individual sounds like rain, a coffee shop, or birds singing, and adjusting their volume. The YouTube player will be positioned in the corner of the screen, and the user can change the corner, turn off the music, or pause it from that widget.

If the user is working on a task, the task panel will be displayed on the focus page so the user can quickly change some task details without leaving the focus page. It includes the task name, description, links, and checklist.

The user can enable focus notifications that will appear as browser notifications, and they can toggle if they want a sound when notifications appear. Types of notifications:

- Session end: when the target work amount is reached, while the session doesn't end automatically, the user will get a notification.
- Workday end: 5 minutes before the workday end, the user will get a notification.
- Eye break: every 20 minutes of uninterrupted work, the user will get a notification to take a 20-second break.

During a focus session, you can hover over the timer to see the log of your current focus session, where each item is either work on a project with a duration, or a break with a duration.

When finishing a focus session, the user has the option to also 'Change session end time and finish,' which is helpful when the user forgets to stop the session and wants to adjust the end time.

The user can change focus project or task during the session. If the user changes the project, the session will be split into a new one for the new project.

When changing projects Increaser will automatically set a task the user worked on last time for that project. If the user didn't work on any task for that project, there will be no task selected.

While the user will primarily track their work through focus sessions, they can also track time by manually adding a focus session from the side timeline on the focus page. There, they can also edit and delete existing sessions.

When it the time after user's workday end, the focus launcher will be disabled and the user will see a message that they should stop working, but they can unlock the focus launcher if they want to continue working.

## Goals

On the "Goals" page, users can set goals to move closer to their ideal vision. Goals can be marked as done, active, or idea. Each goal includes a deadline, which can be a specific date or the user's age, an emoji, and a plain-text plan on how to achieve it. For numeric goals, users can track progress by entering a value, such as their current net worth toward a 1 million USD goal.

Goals integrate with other tools in Increaser, to support recurring actions needed for many goals, users can link recurring tasks(TaskFactories) or daily habits to a goal or create new ones specifically for it. Users can add or link existing principles to a goal. Users can add or link their vision attributes to a goal, to have a clear connection between their goals and their vision.

At the top of the "Goals" page, a timeline shows goals positioned according to their deadlines, with two view options: age-based and date-based. In age-based view, the user’s age is displayed at the top with day precision, and the timeline has age labels. In date-based view, today’s date is shown at the top, and the timeline displays year labels.

## Projects

On the "Projects" page, users can view all their projects and change their status, edit, or delete them. Each project has a name, emoji, color, and status, which can be "active," "inactive," or "archived." One project, "Other," cannot be deleted. When a user deletes a project, all data associated with that project is reassigned to the "Other" project. Users can reorder projects by dragging them. Each project item displays an emoji, name, a budget or goal (if set), and an indicator if it's a "workday project".

When creating or editing a project, users can choose if the project is limited to workdays (Monday to Friday) and set a weekly budget for how much time they plan to spend on it. If a project has a budget, they can also set a goal to work 'at least X hours' or 'no more than X hours' on the project. For example, users may want to work less on some projects, such as their remote job, and more on personal business projects.

The cumulative chart on the side of the projects page displays two overlaying lines: one for "expected work time," derived from the "work budget" set in preferences, and another for the "total time worked." The X-axis represents the days of the current week, while the Y-axis shows cumulative hours. Above the chart, "Done" indicates the total hours worked so far, "Expected" shows the cumulative hours that should have been completed by this point in the week, and "Difference" highlights any gap between expected and actual time worked. This helps users track their progress against their weekly time goals.

## Preferences

The preferences page could be accessed from the user menu in the top right corner on the sidebar.

On the "Preferences" page, user can set a preference by which time they want to finish their workday.

The user can also select which days are the weekend days. If the user doesn't have a concept of a weekend and work the same amount of time every day, they can remove the weekend days.

The user can set a preference for how much time they want to work on a workday and on a weekend, the total hours will serve as a "work budget" when the user is setting a project budget.

## Timesheet

On the "Timesheet" page, users can track their work time across different projects over a selected period, with options to group the data by days, weeks, months, or years. The interval input below the chart allows users to specify a time range, such as June to August, and view a detailed breakdown of time spent on each project. The right panel shows a percentage breakdown of time across projects, and users can click on a project name to filter the chart to display only that project. The chart is color-coded to represent different projects, and hovering over the bars reveals a detailed time distribution for each period. This provides valuable insights into how time is spent, enabling users to adjust priorities and identify work patterns.

At the top of the chart displayed indicator if a project selected, a selected period, and an average amount of time worked per selected period, e.g. average week or average month.

When the report is grouped by weeks and the user selects either all projects or a specific project, they will see a line showing the budgeted time for the project, or, in the case of all projects, the total budgeted time.

When the report is grouped by days, next to the average day there is also an average workday and weekend time.

When the report is grouped by days, the user has the option to see the "Sessions" view, where instead of a bar chart, they see sessions grouped by days. Sessions are colored according to the projects they belong to. When the user selects a specific project, sessions for other projects will be grayed out.

When the report is grouped by days and no project selected the user can see when the workday started and ended for a specific day.

When the report is grouped by days, the user can see a line with their preffered end of work day time.

## Habits

The "Habits" page includes two sub-pages: "Track" and "Explore."

The "Track" sub-page is organized into columns. The first column lists habits, where each item has an emoji and a name. Clicking on a habit opens a modal where users can manage it. The next column shows habit consistency, represented as a progress ring with a percentage in the center. Hovering over the consistency displays how often the user skips that habit, e.g., "You skip it once every 5 days." After that, there’s a column for habit streaks, where users can view their current streak. The last column occupies the remaining space, featuring a grid where users can view and track their habits. Each cell in the grid represents a day, and users can click on a cell to mark the habit as completed for that day.

Users can "stop" a habit, which will make it "inactive" and clear all tracked data. They can "start" a habit again, making it "active" so tracking can resume.

Users can write a simple plan for each habit, displayed in the habit modal. It should be a short sentence or two explaining how they plan to achieve and maintain the habit, specifying when exactly they will do it during the day.

At the top of the "Track" sub-page, there’s also a "Reset habits" button that resets all habits, providing a fresh start by removing all tracked data and beginning from today.

The "Explore" sub-page presents a list of suggested habits for a fulfilling life, categorized into health, relationships, and work, which users can add to their habits.

To help users remember to track their habits, a prompt appears in the sidebar navigation next to the "Habits" item if they haven't visited the "Habits" page that day.

## Tasks

The "Tasks" page has vide subpages: "Tasks", "Ideas", "Upcoming", "Automation", and "Templates". Users can filter tasks by project.

The "Tasks" subpage is a kanban board with four columns: backlog, todo, inProgress, and done. Users can drag and drop tasks between columns.

In the "Upcoming" subpage, tasks are grouped by either day or week (the user can select between day and week views). The user can drag and drop tasks between days or weeks. This view also includes "forecasted" recurring tasks that will be created automatically at the beginning of a period (e.g., that week or day). These tasks can't be edited, but the user can force the early creation of a recurring task by clicking on the "Create now" button. For example, if the user has a weekly task, a task for the next week will be created at the beginning of that week. If the user wants to edit or start working on it earlier, they can click on the "Create now" button.

Completed tasks are automatically deleted at the beginning of the next week to keep user workspace organized.

A user can assign a task to a project. A user can add links to the task to easily access all the necessary external resources during a focus session. A user can add a checklist/subtasks to a task and then complete those sub-items during a focus session on that task. A user can write a description for a task.

In the 'Automation' subpage, users can set up rules for the automatic creation of recurring tasks. Each rule creates a 'TaskFactory,' an entity responsible for generating tasks based on the specified schedule. Editing or deleting a task created by a TaskFactory does not affect the TaskFactory itself. The cadence could be daily, every workday, every week, or every month. For weekly and monthly tasks, the user can select a "deadline index," which for a week would be a weekday and for the month the day of the month. For example, if the "deadline index" for a weekly task is 4, the task will be created every Friday. Tasks are created at the start of the period, but to make it clear for the user, we show "forecasted" recurring tasks on the "Upcoming" subpage.

In the "Templates" subpage, users can create, edit, and delete task templates. A task template contains the same fields as a task, so when the user creates a task or a TaskFactory, if there are templates for a selected project, they will see an option to use a template, and if they select a template, the task form will be pre-filled with the template data. User can also turn an existing task into a template.

A task have a "Start" button that will start a focus session for that task.

On the "Ideas" sub-page, the user can note down ideas for their projects to avoid forgetting them. An idea has a name, description, project, checklist and links fields. The user can turn an idea into a task by clicking on the "Turn into a task" button. The user can reorder ideas by dragging them.

## Principles

The "Principles" page consists of three sub-pages: "Principles", "Categories" and "Explore."

The "Principles" sub-page the user can add, edit, and delete principles, which consist of a name, description, and category. User can create a category while creating a principle.

On the "Categories" sub-page, the user can add, edit, and delete categories. A category consists of a name and an emoji.

The "Explore" sub-page consists of a list of suggested principles for a fulfilling life, categorized into health, marriage, work, mindset, and finances that the user can add to their principles. Users can filter principles by category.

One of the most important use case for principles is make lessons from mistakes and other experiences and turn them into principles.

## What's New

When there is a new feature or a set of features, there is an announcement on the "What's new" page, which consists of a short clip without audio, a title, a description, and a list of items if it's more than a single update. You can get to the "What's new" page by clicking a bell icon in the top right corner of the sidebar. The bell icon will have a dot with the number of new announcements. When the user clicks on the bell icon, the dot will disappear.

Each announcement consists of a title, description, a YouTube video and a list of items if it's more than a single update. Each item is just a sentence describing an individual change. Also, it includes links to that announcement made on social media, which includes: Telegram, X, LinkedIn, Indie Hackers, Reddit and YouTube.

Website also has a "What's new" page that lists all the updates that have been made to the app. It displays the same content as the app.

## Request Features

On the "Request features" page, there is a list of features proposed by users that consist of a title, description, and an upvote button together with the number of total upvotes. The user can switch between the "ideas" and "done" tabs. To propose a feature, there is a small form on the side of the page so that the user can quickly submit a feature request. The new feature requests will be reviewed by the founder; before that, the feature won't be visible to other users.

## Community

Finally, the "Community" page features a leaderboard of the most productive users over the past seven days, based on total daily work hours. Users are anonymous by default.

## Public Profile

On the "Profile" page the user can enable "public profile" and then their name and country will be shown when they request features or when they are on the leaderboard. Only paid users can enable the public profile.

## Info

App has an "Info" page that serves as a knowledge base for the app. It has articles for each primary tool explaining how to use it and why it's beneficial. Each article has a following order: a title, a first paragraph, an embedded YouTube video, and the content.

## Demo User

In the explanation videos and landing page we display a data for a demo user that should resonate with the user. We have a profile of a remote software engineer making good money, developing his own projects, and having a fulfilling life.

# Data

The user can export their data as a JSON file.

# Website

Hey everyone, Radzion here.

Today I want to share some quick updates we've made to Increaser. Let’s dive right in.

First, you can now stop tracking habits without deleting them. This means if you're not ready to delete a habit but want to pause it, you can make it inactive and all your data stays intact.

Next, we merged the "Track" and "Stats" views for habits into a single page. Now you don't have to switch between different views to manage or track your progress—everything's in one place.

Also, you can now write a plan for each habit, like specifying when exactly you'll do it. It’s a small step that can make a big difference in sticking to your habits. I really encourage you to try this out.

We've made it easier to see how consistent you are with your habits. When you hover over the consistency indicator, it'll show how often you tend to skip that habit, giving you a clearer picture of your habits.

For time tracking, we've added a small but handy feature—now when you're editing the session end time, you can also see the session duration, making it a lot easier to adjust things.

And finally, we added a new article on the "Info" page called "Build habits". It has tips and practical advice for building better habits.

That's all for this update. I hope these changes make your experience a bit smoother and more effective. Give them a try, and let me know what you think.

Thanks for watching, and as always, I appreciate your feedback. See you next time!

Hey everyone, Radzion here.

I wanted to quickly share some updates we’ve added to Increaser that should make your work sessions smoother and more productive.

First off, you can now choose which focus notifications you want to receive. You can get alerts for session end, workday end, or even take eye breaks. This way, you get the right nudges, but only when you actually need them.

Another improvement is the ability to turn focus notification sound alerts on or off directly from the focus page. So, if you want a quiet session without sounds, it’s just a toggle away.

We've also added a neat little feature during focus sessions: you can hover over the timer to see a full log of your current session. It shows the time you’ve spent on each project and breaks you’ve taken, making it easier to keep track of your focus flow.

Lastly, we’ve made saving a bit more effortless. Now, any changes to your tasks, projects, habits, goals, ideas, and principles are saved automatically—no more hitting the save button.

That’s it for now! If you haven’t yet, go ahead and try out these updates, and let me know what you think. Your feedback is always super valuable to me.

Thanks for watching!

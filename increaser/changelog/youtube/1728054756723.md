Hey everyone, Radzion here.

I want to take a quick moment to share some of the latest updates in Increaser that I think you'll find really useful.

First, we've added an option to change the end time when finishing a focus session. This is super helpful if you forget to stop the session—you can now easily adjust the end time before wrapping up.

Related to that, if a session goes on for too long and Increaser stops it automatically, you'll now see an editor pop up where you can quickly adjust the session's end time. No more fuss with editing later; it's all right there when you need it.

We've also made it more comfortable to navigate focus sounds. It should be a lot smoother now to find what helps you focus.

And finally, when you're adding a YouTube video to your focus sounds, we've made it easier. You'll now see a preview of the video, and the name will be filled in automatically based on the video's title—one less thing for you to worry about.

That's it for now. Give these updates a try and let me know what you think. Your feedback is always appreciated!

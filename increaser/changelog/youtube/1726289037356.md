Hey everyone, Radzion here. I wanted to quickly share some new updates that I think you’re going to enjoy.

First up, we’ve improved how sub-tasks work. The "sub-tasks" section won’t show up by default—it only appears if you choose to add sub-tasks. Once added, you can collapse it when it's not needed. Plus, the drag-and-drop handle and remove button for sub-tasks are now visible only when you hover over them, keeping things less cluttered.

We’ve applied the same approach to task links. The "task links" section stays hidden until you press the button to add links. Links take up less space now, making it easier to manage your tasks without extra distractions. It’s a small tweak, but it makes a big difference.

And finally, while you’re working on a task, you can now see real-time updates on the time you’ve spent. Both the time spent and the deadline will always be visible when you select a task.

That’s it! Give these updates a try and let us know what you think. Your feedback helps us keep improving Increaser. Thanks for using the product!

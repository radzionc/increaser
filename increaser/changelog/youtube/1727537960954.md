Hey everyone, Radzion here.

I’ve got a few quick updates on Increaser that should make a big difference.

First, on the project's report page, you can now edit both the start and end boundaries of your selected time interval. Previously, you could only set the start date and had a toggle for including today. Now, with just one simple control, you can fine-tune both dates to analyze any period you want.

We’ve also made an improvement to the YouTube focus music feature. Before, the music would always start from the beginning when you launched a new session. Now, it will continue from where it left off, making your listening experience smoother.

On the tasks page, the project filter now stays active even when switching between tabs or pages. This saves you from having to reapply the filter each time you navigate.

Lastly, we’ve added a new filter for principles by category, so you can easily find what you need in different areas like health, work, or mindset.

That’s all for now. Try out these updates and let me know how they work for you!

See you soon!

Hey! Radzion here.

Today, I want to walk you through the work preferences in Increaser and show you how they can boost your productivity.

First, let's talk about setting your preferred workday end time. This tells Increaser when you aim to finish work each day. With this set, on the Focus page, you'll see a countdown at the bottom of the timeline showing how much time is left until your workday ends. This helps you stay on schedule and wrap up tasks efficiently. Five minutes before your workday ends, Increaser will send you a notification, giving you a heads-up to finalize your work. After your set end time, the Focus launcher is disabled by default, encouraging you to rest and maintain a healthy work-life balance. If you need to continue working, you can easily unlock it, but this feature helps prevent overworking. On the Timesheet page, when viewing your work grouped by days, a line represents your preferred end of work time. This visual cue lets you quickly see if you're consistently working past your intended hours, helping you adjust your habits if needed.

Next, you can choose your weekend days. If you don't follow a traditional workweek, you can adjust or even remove weekend days altogether. This setting affects several parts of the app. It impacts your work budget because you can specify how many hours you plan to work on workdays and weekends. The total work budget is calculated based on the number of workdays and weekend days you've set, helping you manage your time effectively. Projects can be marked as "workday only." Increaser takes your weekend days into account to accurately display progress on the Focus page and Focus launcher for these projects, ensuring you're focusing on the right projects at the right times. Your weekend settings are respected in recurring tasks set to be created every workday. This means tasks scheduled for workdays won't appear on your designated weekend days, helping you maintain a balanced schedule. On the Timesheet page, when viewing your work grouped by days, Increaser displays average work hours for both workdays and weekends. This gives you clear insights into your productivity patterns throughout the week.

Finally, you can specify how many hours you plan to work on workdays and weekends, creating your personal work budget. This preference influences several features. When setting up project budgets and goals on the Projects page, the total budgeted time is capped by your overall work budget. This ensures you don't overcommit and helps you allocate your time wisely across different projects. The cumulative chart on the side of the Projects page displays two lines: one for your "expected work time," derived from your work budget, and another for your "total time worked." This visual comparison lets you see at a glance whether you're on track with your weekly time goals. The chart shows "Done," indicating the total hours worked so far; "Expected," showing how much you planned to work by now; and "Difference," highlighting any gap between expected and actual time worked. On the Timesheet page, when viewing your work grouped by weeks and selecting either all projects or a specific project, you'll see a line representing the budgeted time for that project or the total budgeted time. This helps you monitor your progress and adjust your efforts to meet your goals.

By setting your work preferences, you're customizing Increaser to fit your schedule and objectives, making it a more powerful tool for your productivity.

I encourage you to take a moment to set up your work preferences and experience the benefits firsthand.

Thanks for watching, and happy focusing!

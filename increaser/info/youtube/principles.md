Hey! Radzion here.

Today, I'd like to introduce you to the Principles feature in Increaser.

Principles are the core beliefs and values that guide your life. By defining them in Increaser, you create a solid foundation for your goals and daily actions.

You can organize your principles into categories like health, relationships, career, and more. This helps you focus on different areas of your life and keep everything well-organized.

For example, you might have a principle like "Prioritize Well-being," committing to regular exercise and a balanced lifestyle to maintain your health. Or "Family First," dedicating quality time each day to connect with your loved ones.

One of the powerful aspects of Principles in Increaser is how they connect to your goals. When you set a goal, you can link relevant principles to it. This connection reinforces the underlying values that motivate you, making it clearer why achieving that goal is important to you.

For instance, if your principle is "Prioritize Well-being" and you set a goal to exercise regularly, linking the two keeps you focused and motivated. It reminds you that this goal isn't just a task—it's a reflection of what truly matters to you.

Using Principles in Increaser brings clarity and purpose to your daily routine. It ensures that your productivity aligns with your deepest values.

So give it a try—define the values that will guide you toward your perfect life with the Principles feature in Increaser.

Thanks for watching, and see you next time!

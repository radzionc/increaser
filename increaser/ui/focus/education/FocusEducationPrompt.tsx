            <h3>What is Focus?</h3>
            <Text>
              The Focus feature is designed to help you work deeply on your most
              important tasks without interruptions. By structuring your work
              sessions into focused blocks, you can build productive habits and
              make the most of your time. Here, you'll choose a task or project,
              set your focus duration, and get started!

            <ol>
              <li>
                <Text>
                  <strong>Choose a Project or Task</strong>: Select a project
                  and a specific task you want to work on. If you don't have a
                  project or task yet, you can easily create one.

              </li>
              <li>
                <Text>
                  <strong>Set Focus Duration</strong>: Each focus session can be
                  customized to suit your needs. We recommend 90-minute work
                  blocks, which align with our philosophy of maximizing focus
                  without burnout. You can also adjust the start time if you've
                  already begun working.

                  fatigue.

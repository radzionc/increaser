      <h3>Creating and Managing Principles</h3>
      <p>
        On the <strong>'Principles'</strong> sub-page, you can add, edit, and
        delete your personal principles. Each principle consists of a name,
        description, and category. Categories help you organize your principles
        for easier reference. If you don't have a suitable category, you can
        create one directly while adding a new principle.
      </p>

      <h3>Categorizing Your Core Beliefs</h3>
      <p>
        The <strong>'Categories'</strong> sub-page allows you to manage your
        principle categories. Each category has a name and an emoji, making it
        simple to visually organize your principles. Categories might include
        areas like Health, Relationships, Work, Mindset, and Finances.
      </p>

      <h3>Exploring Suggested Principles</h3>
      <p>
        The <strong>'Explore'</strong> sub-page offers a curated list of
        suggested principles for a fulfilling life. These are organized into
        categories such as Health, Marriage, Work, Mindset, and Finances. You
        can browse through these suggestions and add any that resonate with you
        to your personal list of principles.
      </p>

      <h3>Integrating Principles with Other Tools</h3>
      <p>
        Your principles are more than just statements; they are the guiding
        compass for your goals, habits, and daily actions. When setting goals in
        the <strong>'Goals'</strong> tool, you can link relevant principles to
        keep your core beliefs aligned with your objectives. Similarly, when
        managing your habits in the <strong>'Habits'</strong> tool, referencing
        your principles can help reinforce the reasons behind your daily
        routines.
      </p>

      <h3>Turning Experiences into Wisdom</h3>
      <p>
        One of the most valuable uses of the 'Principles' feature is to distill
        lessons from your experiences. Whenever you encounter a significant
        event or realize a profound insight, capture it as a principle. This
        practice helps transform fleeting moments into lasting wisdom that
        guides your future decisions.
      </p>

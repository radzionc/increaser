      <h2>Working with Focus Sessions</h2>
      <p>
        The core of the Focus tool lies in the concept of focus sessions, which
        are timed work blocks followed by short breaks. You can initiate a
        session by selecting a project and an optional task, helping you stay
        focused on a specific goal. Each session aims to maximize your
        productivity by dividing work into manageable chunks—typically 90-minute
        blocks—with well-timed breaks in between.
      </p>

      <h2>Automatic Breaks and Session Management</h2>
      <p>
        Breaks are automatically suggested based on the duration of your focus
        sessions, allowing you to recharge before the next work block. The tool
        also supports automatic sessions if your work duration exceeds certain
        thresholds, making it easy to maintain productivity without overworking.
        If you forget to end a session, Increaser can auto-stop it, giving you
        an option to adjust the end time to reflect your actual work accurately.
      </p>

      <h2>Project and Task Integration</h2>
      <p>
        The Focus tool integrates seamlessly with your projects and tasks. You
        can create, edit, or delete tasks directly within an active focus
        session, making it easy to adapt to changes. You can also view an
        overview of your progress for each project, helping you decide where to
        direct your efforts to stay on track with your weekly goals.
      </p>

      <h2>Focus Music and Notifications</h2>
      <p>
        Stay in the zone by playing focus music or creating your own ambient
        sound mix from sources like rain, coffee shop noise, or birdsong.
        Notifications help you keep track of session endings, workday
        milestones, and eye breaks. These notifications keep you informed
        without interrupting your workflow, letting you maintain a consistent
        pace throughout the day.
      </p>

      <h2>Integration with Other Tools</h2>
      <p>
        The Focus tool is deeply connected to other parts of Increaser. Time
        tracking through focus sessions contributes to your project reports,
        helping you analyze how your time is spent. The "Time Planning" and
        "Work Budget" tools complement the Focus tool by letting you set goals
        for specific projects and allocate your time effectively. Together,
        these tools create a comprehensive system to ensure every workday is
        productive and aligned with your vision and goals.
      </p>

      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>
        In short, the Focus tool provides a structured environment to manage
        your work sessions, minimize distractions, and keep you motivated. By
        combining focus sessions, automatic breaks, seamless project
        integration, and insightful analytics, it ensures your productivity
        aligns with your overall goals and vision.

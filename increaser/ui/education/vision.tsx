      <h2>What Is Vision?</h2>
      <p>
        Vision is where you define what your perfect life looks like. It’s built
        around “vision attributes,” which are personal statements describing key
        aspects of your ideal life. Each attribute includes a name, an emoji, an
        image, and a description to help you visualize your goals clearly.
      </p>
      <h2>How Vision Works</h2>
      <p>
        The Vision tool has two subpages: "Board" and "Explore." The Board
        subpage is your personal vision board, displaying all your vision
        attributes as a gallery of images. Hover over an image to see its name
        and emoji, or click to view details, edit, or delete the attribute. The
        Explore subpage offers suggested vision attributes to inspire you. You
        can add these suggestions directly to your board.
      </p>
      <h2>Connecting Vision to Goals</h2>
      <p>
        Vision integrates closely with the Goals tool to help you turn your
        aspirations into actionable steps. On the Goals page, you can link
        vision attributes to specific goals. This creates a clear connection
        between your ideal life and the concrete actions needed to achieve it.
        For example, if one of your vision attributes is “Healthy Lifestyle,”
        you can set a goal to exercise daily and track your progress over time.
        Linking vision attributes to goals ensures that your daily efforts align
        with your bigger picture.
      </p>
      <h2>Why Use Vision?</h2>
      <p>
        Visualizing your ideal life not only motivates you but also helps
        clarify your priorities. By turning dreams into tangible attributes, you
        create a compass that guides your decisions and keeps you focused on
        what truly matters. Vision isn’t just about imagining—it’s about
        building a framework for action and progress.

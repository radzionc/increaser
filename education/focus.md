Hey! Radzion here. Today, I want to walk you through the Focus Tool in Increaser—one of the most powerful ways to boost your productivity and get into that deep, focused state we all strive for.

Let’s dive right in. Imagine you’re about to start working. You open the Focus page. First thing you see is the focus launcher—this is where you set up your focus session. Choose your project, pick a task if you’d like, and just hit Start. It’s that easy. You can even create new tasks or projects right from here, which means less time setting up, and more time getting stuff done.

What makes Focus Tool unique is how it encourages you to work in structured blocks—ideally 90 minutes at a time. You’re maximizing productivity without burning out. Increaser even suggests optimal break times between sessions, so you stay energized and don’t push yourself past the point of productivity.

During your session, there’s more than just a timer. The Focus Tool becomes your workspace hub—a timeline shows your daily sessions, color-coded by project, so you can visually track your progress. Plus, if you’re managing a task, the task panel is right there, so you can easily update details, check off subtasks, or even add links without disrupting your flow.

And let’s say you forget to stop the session—it happens. No worries. Increaser will automatically stop it automatically after a while, and you can adjust the session end time later. You can also easily add and edit sessions without using the focus timer. Those sessions are tracked, allowing you to see reports on how much time you spend on projects and how much you are working. Everything is designed to keep you focused, without distractions or penalties for being human.

Another thing I love—you can play ambient focus sounds to get in the zone. Mix your favorite background noises or play tracks straight from YouTube, all built-in so you’re not clicking around other tabs searching for the perfect vibe.

But productivity is not just about getting things done. It’s also about noticing when you need a pause. Increaser’s got you covered here too. With gentle reminders for eye breaks, workday wrap-ups, and more, you’ll have prompts to keep a balanced routine.

All of these elements come together to help you get in the zone, stay in the zone, and know when to take a break—without the hassle of micromanaging your own focus time. And of course, everything connects with your projects, tasks, and goals in Increaser, giving you a complete, interconnected toolkit to own your productivity.

Thanks for watching. Go ahead, give the Focus Tool a try, and feel the difference in how you work. See you next time.
